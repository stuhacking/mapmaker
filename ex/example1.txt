# A Simple Example

# 'sprites' defines the path to a sprite sheet and the dimensions
# of an individual sprite.
sprites <path/to/sprites.png> 48 48

# 'image' defines the output image dimensions (in tiles) and number
# of layers.
image 6 6 1

# 'srand' reseeds the random number generator which only takes
# effect if a glyph is mapped to multiple variations.
srand 100

# 'g' defines a glyph for a specific layer. The glyph is
# an ASCII or UTF-8 character which maps to a rotation of one or more
# tiles in the sprite sheet zero indexed from the top leftmost tile.
# If a glyph has multiple tiles, a random one will be selected.
glyph 0 . 0  145
glyph 0 , 0  146 147 148
glyph 0 + 0  21

# Lines which start with a numeral are then assumed to be rows in the
# top-down map representation. The first number is the layer, second is the
# row index, then any non-whitespace tile are columns. If the character
# corresponds to a glyph, then this sprite will be written to the final image.
