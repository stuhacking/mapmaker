# A Simple Example

# 's' defines the path to a sprite sheet and the dimensions
# of an individual sprite.
s <path/to/sprites.png> 48 48

# 'i' defines the output image dimensions (in tiles) and number
# of layers.
i 6 6 1

# 'r' defines a custom random seed which only takes effect if
# a glyph is mapped to multiple variations.
r 100

# Base Ground and variations

# 'g' defines a glyph for a specific layer. The glyph is
# an ASCII or UTF-8 character which maps to a rotation of one or more
# tiles in the sprite sheet zero indexed from the top leftmost tile.
# If a glyph has multiple tiles, a random one will be selected.
g 0 . 0  145
g 0 , 0  146 147 148
g 0 + 0  21

# Lines which start with a numeral are then assumed to be rows in the
# top-down map representation. The first number is the layer, second is the
# row index, then any non-whitespace tile are columns. If the character
# corresponds to a glyph, then this sprite will be written to the final image.
